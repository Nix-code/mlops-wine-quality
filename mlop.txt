3. Git command
4. Basic python


DVC 

helps to version or keep track of your ML model and data
so if any changes made can be tracked

Github has certain limitations

we cannot push large file in it

so dvc creates .dvc file, which keeps tracks about the info of 
where actually our data is and data can be stored in remote storage s3 bucket



2 components

params.yaml

parameters configuaration

dvc.yaml
all the stages
(data gathering)
(Data preprocessing)
(Training)
(evaluation)

if the file is too big, 
  we can specify the changes in params.yaml
  to reduce buggy codes 

store in centralized location

 ymal, yet another markup language

 p1:v1
 p2:p2
